      <div class="profile">
        <p>I'm an aspiring engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering, and I've immersed myself in the world of full-stack web development, Python, C/C++, and Linux. But these skills are just the beginning—they are my tools for exploring the limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>What really drives me is my insatiable curiosity and love for learning. Every new technology I explore, every challenge I face, and every collaboration I join is an opportunity to grow, both as a professional and as a person. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think differently and push my boundaries.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Collaboration and co-existence are at the heart of everything I do. I firmly believe that the best ideas come from working with diverse teams, sharing knowledge, and uplifting each other. By building strong connections, we can create solutions that are more impactful than anything we could achieve alone.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>My goal is to use technology to make a positive difference. Whether it's designing user-friendly websites, developing secure systems, or exploring the future of AI, I'm passionate about leveraging my skills to contribute to the betterment of society. For me, it's not just about innovating—it's about ensuring that the work I do leaves a lasting, positive impact on others and the communities around me.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>If you share my enthusiasm for learning, innovation, and using technology for good, I'd love to connect! Whether you're working on a project, looking for collaboration, or just want to chat about new ideas, I'm always excited to meet like-minded people. Let's explore, learn, and grow together as we build a future where technology uplifts everyone.</p>
